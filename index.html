<p>Hello! this brief blog is dedicated to the sports i enjoy and practice, i'm an active openwater swimmer, and huge football fan,soccer for those in the US, but the entire world knows the sport as football so let's keep at that <i><strong>FOOTBALLâš½âš½âš½âš½âš½</i></strong></p>
<p>I'm also a motor sport fan and basically any sport catches my attention, except tennis which i hate, hate is probably a bit harsh...so let's say i don't enjoy it at all and any other made up games like cornhole, you might ask yourself what is that anyway??!!??, now that i mentioned it i have to add a link to the "game or sport", remember it's for information purposes only...</p><br>
<p> If we were to make a kinda list with my favorite sports it would be something like so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Swimming (open water and in the pool)
  <li>Football
  <li>Motor Sports (f1)(motogp)(rally)(wec)
  <li>Rugby (huge all blacks fan, i might get into why later on)
    <hr>
</ul>
<p>I have certain atheletes i follow some on social media others i don't, i really enjoy watching them perform on their stage so let's make a small list of atheletes in their respective sport without gettin into specifics of why i like em, if you'd like more info on them follow the links</p>
